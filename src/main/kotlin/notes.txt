Notes:
- Don't add limits (ie, must be from 0-100)

I need to write down how I want the language to work more. I need to do this as I'm confused about what should/shouldn't be added/what is/isn't valid.
Probably in Obsidian

To-do:

Writing:
    ~emptyMap
    ~emptyList
	Comments #
	    ~Lists
	    Lists in lists
	    Map
	    Maps in maps
	    List & map recursion
	~Maps
	    ~Lists in maps
	    ~Maps in lists
	    ~Many maps in lists & lists in maps
	~Lists
	~Ints
	~Doubles
	~Strings
        ~Explicit/multiline strings ("")
                ~Multiline
                ~Ints
                ~Double
                ~Bools
                ~emptyList
                ~emptyMap
                ~Whitespace ie "    Yo    "
                ~Colons
                ~#
	~Booleans
Reading:
	Comments #
	Maps
	Lists
	Ints
	Doubles
	Strings
	Booleans
	Explicit/multiline strings ("")
	Empty list (emptyList)
	Empty map (emptyMap)
